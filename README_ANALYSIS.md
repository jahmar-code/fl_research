# Federated Learning Privacy Analysis

This document provides an overview of the analysis results and how to navigate them.

## Key Files

1. **research_findings.md**

   - Original research findings document with IID experiment results
   - Includes theoretical privacy guarantees and practical recommendations

2. **non_iid_findings.md**

   - New analysis focused on non-IID experiments (α=0.1)
   - Explores the impact of data heterogeneity on privacy mechanisms
   - Contains revised recommendations for heterogeneous data scenarios

3. **analyze_results.py**
   - Python script that generates all visualizations and analysis
   - Includes both IID and non-IID results
   - Creates comparison visualizations between the two data distributions

## Visualization Directory

The `analysis_results` directory contains the following:

1. **Original Visualizations** (from earlier analysis)

   - `privacy_utility_tradeoff.png` - Basic privacy-utility tradeoff
   - `privacy_metrics_comparison.png` - Detailed privacy metrics
   - `3d_tradeoff.png` - 3D visualization of privacy, utility, and communication
   - `comprehensive_comparison.png` - Side-by-side comparison of key metrics

2. **IID-specific Visualizations** (prefixed with "iid\_")

   - Same visualizations as above but specifically for IID data

3. **Non-IID-specific Visualizations** (prefixed with "non*iid*")

   - Same visualizations as above but specifically for non-IID data with α=0.1

4. **Comparison Visualizations** (in the `comparison` subfolder)
   - `iid_vs_non_iid_accuracy.png` - Direct comparison of accuracy between IID and non-IID
   - `privacy_heterogeneity_tradeoff.png` - Relationship between privacy protection and heterogeneity sensitivity
   - `accuracy_retention.png` - How well each approach retains accuracy with heterogeneity
   - `three_way_tradeoff.png` - Three-way tradeoff between privacy, utility, and heterogeneity
   - `performance_comparison.csv` - Detailed metrics table in CSV format

## Key Findings

1. **Privacy-Utility Tradeoff**: Stronger privacy protections lead to lower model accuracy
2. **Data Heterogeneity Impact**: Non-IID data reduces performance across all approaches
3. **Resilience Differences**: HE shows surprising resilience to heterogeneity
4. **Vulnerability of Hybrid Approach**: The hybrid approach struggles most with non-IID data
5. **Three-way Tradeoff**: There's a complex relationship between privacy, utility, and data heterogeneity

## How to Run Additional Analysis

To run the analysis script again or with modified parameters:

```bash
docker run -it --rm -v $(pwd):/app fl_research python /app/analyze_results.py
```

To modify the analysis:

1. Edit the `iid_results` and `non_iid_results` dictionaries in `analyze_results.py` with updated metrics
2. Run the script to generate new visualizations
3. The script will preserve the original visualizations by using prefixes

## Additional Testing Suggestions

1. **Test with different α values**:

   - Run experiments with α=0.3 and α=0.5 to see the impact of varying degrees of heterogeneity
   - Update the analysis script to include these results

2. **Test with different noise multipliers**:

   - Experiment with lower noise multipliers (0.2-0.3) for DP and hybrid approaches
   - Analyze the impact on privacy-utility-heterogeneity tradeoff

3. **Explore personalization**:
   - Implement personalization techniques to address non-IID challenges
   - Compare performance with and without personalization
