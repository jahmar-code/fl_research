   - Explores the impact of data heterogeneity on privacy mechanisms
   - Contains revised recommendations for heterogeneous data scenarios
   - Analyzes the performance of our novel Sequential Hybrid approach

3. **generate_plots.py**

   - Python script that creates all visualizations used in the report
   - Includes comprehensive plots for both IID and non-IID results
   - Produces standard and sequential hybrid comparison visualizations

4. **analyze_results.py**
   - Python script that performs detailed data analysis
   - Processes experimental results and generates insights
   - Creates additional comparison visualizations between approaches

## Visualization Directory

The `analysis_results` directory contains the following:

1. **Core Visualizations**

   - `iid_comprehensive_comparison.png` - Learning curves for all approaches (IID)
   - `non_iid_comprehensive_comparison.png` - Learning curves for all approaches (non-IID)
   - `iid_privacy_utility_tradeoff.png` - Privacy-utility tradeoff under IID conditions
   - `non_iid_privacy_utility_tradeoff.png` - Privacy-utility tradeoff under non-IID conditions

2. **Sequential Hybrid Analysis**

   - `sequential_vs_standard_comparison_iid.png` - Comparison of sequential vs standard hybrid approaches (IID)
   - `sequential_vs_standard_comparison_non_iid.png` - Comparison in non-IID settings
   - `privacy_metrics_comparison.png` - Detailed privacy metrics across all approaches

3. **Heterogeneity Analysis**

   - `iid_vs_non_iid_accuracy.png` - Direct comparison of accuracy between IID and non-IID
   - `privacy_heterogeneity_tradeoff.png` - Relationship between privacy protection and heterogeneity sensitivity
   - `accuracy_retention.png` - How well each approach retains accuracy with heterogeneity

4. **Multi-dimensional Analysis**
   - `3d_tradeoff.png` - Three-way tradeoff between privacy, utility, and communication
   - `communication_overhead.png` - Communication efficiency comparison
   - `performance_comparison.csv` - Comprehensive results table in CSV format

## Key Findings

1. **Privacy-Utility Tradeoff**: Stronger privacy protections lead to lower model accuracy, with performance declining from baseline (68.34%) to HE (57.90%), DP (35.05%), and hybrid approaches (33-35%)

2. **Data Heterogeneity Impact**: Non-IID data reduces performance across all approaches, but with varying degrees - HE maintains 94.39% of its accuracy while Standard Hybrid retains only 68.53%

3. **Sequential vs Standard Hybrid**: Our novel Sequential Hybrid approach (33.51% IID accuracy) improves learning stability and heterogeneity resilience compared to the Standard Hybrid approach

4. **Communication Efficiency**: HE-based approaches reduce communication overhead by 94% compared to baseline and DP approaches

5. **Three-way Tradeoff**: Complex relationships exist between privacy, utility, communication efficiency, and heterogeneity resilience

## How to Run Additional Analysis

To run the analysis script again or with modified parameters:

```bash
docker run -it --rm -v $(pwd):/app fl_research python /app/analyze_results.py
```

To generate all plots:

```bash
docker run -it --rm -v $(pwd):/app fl_research python /app/generate_plots.py
```

## Additional Testing Suggestions

1. **Test with different α values**:

   - Run experiments with α=0.3 to see the impact of intermediate heterogeneity levels
   - Compare with current results (α=0.5) to establish a trend

2. **Test with different noise multipliers**:

   - For the Sequential Hybrid approach, test noise multipliers in the range 0.2-0.5
   - Analyze the impact on privacy-utility-heterogeneity tradeoff

3. **Parameter optimization for Sequential Hybrid**:
   - Explore different combinations of DP noise parameters and HE quantization bits
   - Find optimal parameter settings for various heterogeneity levels

## Visualization Guide for Reports

When incorporating visualizations into reports, we recommend:

1. **Core Results**: Include iid_privacy_utility_tradeoff.png, iid_comprehensive_comparison.png, and 3d_tradeoff.png in the main results section

2. **Sequential Hybrid Analysis**: Feature sequential_vs_standard_comparison_iid.png and sequential_vs_standard_comparison_non_iid.png when discussing the novel approach

3. **Heterogeneity Impact**: Use iid_vs_non_iid_accuracy.png and accuracy_retention.png to demonstrate varying resilience to data heterogeneity

4. **Communication Efficiency**: Include communication_overhead.png when discussing resource requirements
